#AngularJS Book App:

A simple application for adding and removing notes to book chapters.

##Functionality:

* App built following MVC paradigm.
* Angular  ```service``` provider was used to create models.
* Views are served by router and tied with the corresponding controllers. 
* ```localStorage``` used as data persistence layer.
* No server.   
## Installation

App routing relies on ngRoute dependency which requires server solution. You can either set up your local server or host the files remotely.
